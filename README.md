# I'm Ruben
### a back-end web developer working with __Ruby__ and the __Rails framework__ with an interest in systems and their architecture, flows, and imposing infiniteness.

ðŸŒ¿ Some projects I've contributed to and worked on are:

* [Voidflowers](https://github.com/hobbiathan/voidflowers) - A Rails application meant to act as a repository for personal projects implementing ActiveStorage, BCrypt, DigitalOcean Spaces, and user sessions
* [Enigma](https://github.com/hobbiathan/ruby_enigma) - A simple CLI script to encrypt/decrypt string messages utilzing a simple encryption method based off of the Enigma Machine
* [Tea Subscription](https://github.com/hobbiathan/TeaSubscription) - A simple API engine with CRUD functionality for a hypothetical tea service
* [Sweater Weather](https://github.com/hobbiathan/sweater-weather) - A more complex API engine that can provide directions between two provided locations, food places of a specific sort within a respective location, images of a location, etc... (documentation pending)
* [Spin Spot](https://github.com/stevenjames-turing/SPINSPOT) - A full-stack application that can retrieve articles based off a provided keyword and supply the user with AI generated summaries to provide a rough wholistic view of bias between various political-biased sources.
