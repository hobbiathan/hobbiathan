# 👁‍🗨 Hello, I'm Ruben.

### I'm a back-end web developer working with __Ruby__ and the __Rails framework__ with an interest in systems and their architecture, flows, and imposing infiniteness.


🌿 Notable skills include:
* Comprehensive understanding of apps utilizng MVC architecture 
* RSpec Model/Controller/Request testing
* Heroku Deployment
* The vi/vim/nvim editor
* Git/GitHub workflow
* PostgreSQL/Postico

🌶 Some projects I've contributed and worked on are:

* [Enigma](https://github.com/hobbiathan/ruby_enigma) - A simple CLI script to encrypt/decrypt string messages utilzing a simple encryption method based off of the Enigma Machine
* [Tea Subscription](https://github.com/hobbiathan/TeaSubscription) - A simple API engine with CRUD functionality for a hypothetical tea service
* [Sweater Weather](https://github.com/hobbiathan/sweater-weather) - A more complex API engine that can provide directions between two provided locations, food places of a specific sort within a respective location, images of a location, etc... (documentation pending)
* [Spin Spot](https://github.com/stevenjames-turing/SPINSPOT) - A full-stack application that can retrieve articles based off a provided keyword and supply the user with AI generated summaries to provide a rough wholistic view of bias between various political-biased sources.

👾  Currently, I've invested myself into a few new things to learn:
* The Go Language
